Mesozoic Majesty
Megalodon, this prehistoric sized giant is the supersize Christmas Wreath making way for the greatest statement a household could make without privileges usually reserved to royalty. This horizontal monolith traditionally coloured and decorative Wreath is a whopping stretch boasting a Mesozoic sized 55cm diameter presence. A classic forest cabin with a runaway Elf mobile racing an urgent last minute festive deliver. This powerfully packed to the rafterâ€™s piece will need a matching powerful personality to handle the magical oversized mamoth. The uniquely spotted warning of enchanted Forest Mushrooms begins the tentative journey of traditional pine branches hosting a plethora of red, green and gold ornaments boasting multiple sizes creating a brilliant visual display of ornamental masonry. As usual complimented with handpicked natural items including Pinecones, Gum Nuts, all carefully complimented with scatterings of green leaves and foliage. Heavy weighs the crown so why not be the envied royals this Christmas and display this undisputed heavy weight that sets the bar for festive Majesty. Measurements: 55 cm, weight 1570 gr.
